                <h3>Here's a history of devices and inventions:</h3>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li><Span>200 BC to 70 BC</Span> - Unknown exact date, the Antikythera mechanism is the oldest example of an analog 
                        computer. It was used by the Greeks to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance. 
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>850</Span> - The book of ingenious devices created by the Banu Musa at the House of Wisdom, is a large 
                        illustrated work on mechanical devices. One of them was an automatic flute player which is possibly the 
                        first programmable machine. 
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1206</Span> - Ismail Al-Jazari of the Artuqid State is known for his elephant clock invention which is useful 
                        for recording the hours to match uneven lengths in days. It makes use of of a humanoid robot and a mechanical bird 
                        which is why he's know as the father of robotics.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>~1670</Span> - One of the first computer scientists, Gottfried Leibniz worked on the the calculus ratiocinator 
                        as well as developments on first-order logic which were foundations of computer science.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1837</Span> - The analyitical engine invented by Charles Babbage is an improvement on his previous work, the 
                        difference engine. It was a general purpose computer that was able to have control flow, conditionals, loops, a logic 
                        unit, and memory.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1852</Span> - Building off of Babbage's analyitical engine, Ada Lovelace proposed that it could be used for 
                        more than calculations, it could be a program solving complex problems. 
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1936</Span> - The turing machine was invented and it became the foundation of computing. Using a memory tape, 
                        it was capable of arbitrary computation and was able to solve the Entscheidungsproblem.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1947</Span> - The first assembly language, ARC and it was written by Kathleen Booth. The assembly code was 
                        converted to executable machine code called the assembler. 
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1969</Span> - The first Unix operating system was designed by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs. Furthermore, he invented 
                        the B programming language which was a direct predecessor of the C language. It was a typeless language so the only data
                        types that could be used was the machines memory. Later on he developed the C language which allowed user-defined types.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1979</Span> - C with classes was invented by Bjarne Stroustrup, later on named C++. It had OOP, constructors, 
                        destructors, and built-in and user-defined types.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>1989</Span> - The world wide web was invented and the first HTTP communcation between client and server was sent. 
                        Tim Berners-Lee had the idea of combining hypertext with TCP and DNS to get the WWW.
                    </li>

                    <li><Span>2000</Span> - In the late 1990s and early 2000s came computer virusus and in May 5th 2000, the love bug worm was 
                        sent as a social engineering attack affecting millions of computers worldwide. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
